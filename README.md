# ZoneManager
Simple and straight forward zone management module

## How to automatically register Zones?
Add a tag to your zone (must be a Part, MeshPart, or a Model) named 'Zone' and you're done!

## How can I set the zone name without changing the Part/Models name?
Create a string attribute named 'Alias' and then set it to whatever you want the name to be

## Where can I find documentation?
Docs can be found [here](https://re-sync-dev.github.io/ZoneManager/api/ZoneManager)
